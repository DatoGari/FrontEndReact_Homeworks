          <h2>Development Program Specialist</h2>
          <p>Over the course of my 25+ years of service with USAID, I have developed a comprehensive skill set,
             with expertise in program budgeting, financial analysis, and reporting. I have demonstrated resilience 
             and perseverance in the face of challenging situations, which has contributed significantly to my personal 
             and professional growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career at USAID, I have consistently managed the Missionâ€™s program budget, ensuring its effective 
            planning and monitoring. I have developed and implemented efficient systems and tools for resource planning, 
            tracking fund commitments and obligations, which has ensured that all Mission programs received timely and adequate 
            funding.
